Horiseon Website Cleanup (Challenge 1)

For this challenge I cleaned up some HTML and CSS. As far as the HTML file, I saw there were some unecessary divs and named them things such as article and header to use semantics, fixed the search engine optimization in the navigation section, and added commentary. 

Ass far as CSS goes, I added commentary, and I also grouped properties together to cut down on the amount of declarations. I also reduced the amount of fonts that were listed because I thought listing 5-8 fonts seemed unnecessary. 

I also created a new repository on GitHub for the challenge.
